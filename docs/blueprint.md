## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vivid blue (#29ABE2) to evoke a sense of energy, confidence, and intelligence. It is suitable for a competitive learning environment.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F8FF), near white, for a clean and distraction-free backdrop.
- Accent color: Purple (#9C27B0), is used sparingly for buttons and interactive elements to draw attention. It offers good contrast against the blue palette and gives a touch of originality.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif, to give a computerized and techy feel. Body font: 'Inter', sans-serif. Space Grotesk and Inter make for a good pairing.
- Use clean and modern icons to represent different question types and quiz actions.

- Subtle animations for question transitions and score updates.
